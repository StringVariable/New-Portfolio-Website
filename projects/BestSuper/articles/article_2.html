					<h2>Does your super have any hidden talents? Find out.</h2>
				</header>
				<small class="accent">8th of May, 2016 | Christopher Martin</small>
				<p>Aside from being a fantastic avenue to save for your later years in retirement, superannuation also provides you
					with a lot of benefits which you perhaps had not known about. For example, contributing to your superannuation is
					an easy way to pay less tax every financial year. If you set up a salary sacrifice agreement with your current
					place of employment, you arrange to exchange the income tax rate you normally pay every year for a much more stylish
					super contributions tax rate, which is <span class="accent">15% less.</span>
				</p>
				<p>Another hidden talent that is always lurking around a superannuation plan is cheaper insurance. Seeing as though a
					lot of super funds in fact purchase insurances in large quantities, they have the leeway to offer cheaper deals with
					common insurers. In which case, this creates insurance covers that are substantially cheaper when purchased via a super
					fund than other independent insurance companies. </p>

				<p>The final sneaky, little-known benefit/talent of today's modern superannuation super funds is that they protect you largely
				from going brankrupt once you retire. If you have your savings inside of a super fund that is regulated by the government, in
				most cases this means that your money inside this fund is protected from creditors in the unfortunate event that you may need
				to file for bankruptcy. View this as a sort of backup plan, incase any unforeseen circumstances may become of your small
				business/start up. You can sleep well knowing that your finances are kept safe.</p>

				<p>Turns out my super actually does a lot for me than I first realised. Interesting article. Kind of, actually, VERY relevent for me
					right now because I'm just looking at getting into the tech startup scene. It's good to know that some of my investments can be protected
					incase one of these business go down the drain. Hopefully not though, lol! Thanks again, good read.
