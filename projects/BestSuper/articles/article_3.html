					<h2>Buying life insurance that doesn't hit the hip pocket.</h2>
				</header>
				<small class="accent">1st of May, 2016 | Elliott Moore</small>
				<p>While your super most likely includes some insurance as standard, for many people it isn’t
					enough. You can usually get additional insurance through your super with no out of pocket
					expenses (it’s all paid through your super).</p>
				<p>A lot of superannuation companies in this modern day offer increasingly cheaper insurance covers and packages.
					It’s part of their many hidden benefits that a lot people don’t realise come associated with a superannuation plan.
					It’s relatively simple, as long as you are making consistent super contributions, your trust company can provide to
					you discounted life insurance prices.</p>
				<p>How can they do this, you ask? It’s because of how super companies purchase their life insurance policies. They buy
					them in bulk from insurance providers which yields them a cheaper price overall, with the money they save from the
					bulk purchasing, they can afford to offer it to their customers for a discounted price. If you’re a member of a large
					super fund (such as an industry fund or retail fund or public sector fund), and you joined the super fund via your
					employer, then you’re likely to have access to a competitive deal in life insurance. In most cases, any super fund
					that you have joined via your employer, will provide life insurance at very competitive rates because you will be
					covered under a ‘group’ policy rather than individual policy which spreads the risk over a greater number of people
					and generally means better rates. </p>
