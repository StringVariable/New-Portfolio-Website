				<p>Superannuation is a system put in place in Australia that enable them to have funds available for them in retirement.
						This system is support by the Australian government and they encourage all employed people to provide a minimum
						contribution whilst working. This system was introduced in 1992 by the Australian government in an attempt to combat
						Australia’s ageing population issue. The system was introduced so as to guarantee some savings are available for
						retirees. In a sense, supperannuation is just a long-term savings plan put into place now while you work, so you can
					 	enjoy the benefits of the plan once you retire.</p>

				<p><span class="accent">So why should I care about this?</span> Start to save for your retirement early, i.e. right now! The longer time you have
						to save your money, the more chance and time your savings have to grow. For a lot of people, super contributions will
						also be taxed at a lower rate than other investments outside super. That’s not all, if you place your own money into
						your super fund (not money taxed by the government) you can even receive a government support contribution, depending
					 	on how much you currently earn. If you earn upwards of $37,000 you could also be eligible for a ‘low income super
					 	contribution’ of anywhere from $100 - $500 from the Australian government. You’ll also get this payment regardless
					 	if you add your own money to your super account or not.</p>

				<p>You may also be able to get other insurances such as death, disability or income protection insurance at a less expensive
						price if you are already apart of a supperannuation program. You can read about some of these in our related articles. So
						there are some of the many benefits of opening up and contribution to your super. It's something that can easily slip past
						you in such early years of your life as you are enjoying/pre-occupied with other affairs, however if you get in early, you will
						gain full advantage of the benefits later in your life.</p>
