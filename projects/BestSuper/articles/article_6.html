				<p>It’s YOUR money. Always remember that, no matter who you’re talking to about your super. Nobody can force you
					 to do anything with it but yourself. But just keep in mind superannuation is there for your best interest in
					 the end. </p>
				<p>A quick recap of superannuation and tips to help you out. Start to save for your retirement early, i.e. right
					now! The longer time you have to save your money, the more chance and time your savings have to grow. For a lot
					 of people, super contributions will also be taxed at a lower rate than other investments outside super. That’s
					 not all, if you place your own money into your super fund (not money taxed by the government) you can even
					 receive a government support contribution, depending on how much you currently earn. If you earn upwards of
					 $37,000 you could also be eligible for a ‘low income super contribution’ of anywhere from $100 - $500 from
					 the Australian government. You’ll also get this payment regardless if you add your own money to your super
					 account or not.</p>
				<p>You may also be able to get other insurances such as death, disability or income protection insurance at a
					less expensive price if you are already apart of a supperannuation program. You can read about some of these
					in our related articles. So there are some of the many benefits of opening up and contribution to your super.
					It's something that can easily slip past you in such early years of your life as you are enjoying/pre-occupied
					with other affairs, however if you get in early, you will gain full advantage of the benefits later in your life.</p>
				<p>It never hurts to talk to someone to make sure you’re making the most of your hard earned money. And it’s easy
						to get in touch with us. <a href="../contact.html">Contact us</a> and have a conversation about putting your super to work for you today.</p>
