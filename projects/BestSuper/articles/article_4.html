					<h2>Buy shares in companies you'd like to invest in.</h2>

				<p>Want to buy shares in a public company you enjoy and respect? Options like Self Invest and Member Direct
					plans let you use your super to do just that. You can invest some of your super in any of the top 300 ASX
					listed companies as well as some exchange traded funds. In fact, the Member Direct option offers many of
					the features of a self managed super fund at a fraction of the cost. You can invest in this pathway if
					you’re part of a super trust and are contributing to your super reguarly, if these requirements are met
					you can enjoy features such as those outlined below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Low administration and brokerage fees</li>
					<li>S&amp;P/ASX 300 shares, ETFs and term deposits</li>
					<li>Central cash transaction account</li>
					<li>Live stock quotes and 20 minute delayed market data</li>
					<li>Investment tools including watch lists and investment education</li>
					<li>Easy to use online platform</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Investing your super into shares/stocks is a great way to make some extra money (with your extra money),
					particularly if you do your research and invest wisely. With that said, there some minor restrictions put
					in place as to how shares can be obtained. For example, investments have to be for the absolute sole purpose
					of retirement, i.e they have to directly impact on your retirement benefits for yourself or members of the
					fund. By this same token, any other members (relatives or associates) cannot gain any immediate benefit from
					the fund’s assets or activities. </p>
