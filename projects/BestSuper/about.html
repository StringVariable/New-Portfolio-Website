			<p>All of the staff here at BestSuper have got your best interest in mind. We target our material towards the
				younger demographic of people usually under 30 years of age. So usually our content will revolve around the
				introductory material of superannuation, often times publishing articles relating to what your super actually
				is (we know you’ve probably heard the term often thrown around a lot, what actually is it?), benefits of super
				and why you should be interested in it as you begin your respect careers. The purpose of our online presence is
				to interface with the younger working generation and expose them to information regarding their futures and what
				entitlements they can look forward to in their futures.</p>

			<p>We try to get our users to start to saving for their retirement early, i.e. right now! The longer time
				you have to save your money, the more chance and time your savings have to grow. For a lot of people,
				super contributions will also be taxed at a lower rate than other investments outside super. That’s not
				all, if you place your own money into your super fund (not money taxed by the government) you can even
				receive a government support contribution, depending on how much you currently earn. Super is something
				that can easily slip past you in such early years of your life as you are enjoying/pre-occupied with other
				affairs early in your life, however if you get in early, you will gain full advantage of the benefits later
				in your life. Our team delivers the <span class="accent"><b>right message, to the right person, at the right time!</b></span></p>
