				<p>BestSuper. Wow, what can I say? Thank you so much. I can’t believe how helpful you have been these past
					couple of weeks. I went searching around online for some answers I had to superannuation and all the sites
					 I went to previously just didn’t appeal to me. Then I happened upon your website and eMagazine articles
					 and honestly, good job. You provided me with exactly the information I was after and were to kind and
					 helpful when I called up with extra questions. Just a massive thank you again!
					<br><br>
					 You should put this on your stories page because I truly felt like I went through a journey! :P

				<p>Hey everyone at BestSuper, I just finished up setting up my super fund and found out I got a bunch of discounts for things like
					life insurance. It was such a good surprise! Supperannuation is kind of like the gift that keeps on giving, then gives you one last
					giant gift again when you retire!

				<p>Hello everyone at BestSuper, guess what! If you're a financial enthusiest like myself then I have great news for you. I was at work just this morning
					telling my co-worker how I'd joined a super fund through BestSuper and he told me about a really cool feature of superannuation. You
					can use some of your super to invest in stocks on the Australian Stock eXchange! I've already invested in 3 companies since this morning,
					hopefully they do alright.
